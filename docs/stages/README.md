Release-preparation stages were executed sequentially. Stage 5Q and Stage 5R
are split into atomic sub-stages. Stages 5U.2-5U.4 separate license decision,
metadata application, and package verification. Stage 5V first decides that
`v0.1.0-rc1` is ineligible because it predates final MIT metadata; Stages
5U.5-5U.8 then plan, create, and verify `v0.1.0-rc2`; Stage 5V.1 verifies
TestPyPI readiness, Stage 5V.2 prepares an OIDC-only GitHub Actions TestPyPI
workflow, and Stage 5V.3 registers its exact pending publisher without
publishing. Stage 5V.4 performs and verifies exactly one controlled workflow
publish of exact tag `v0.1.0-rc2` to TestPyPI. Stage 5V.5 verifies public
TestPyPI installation and help-only CLI smoke. Stage 5W prepares evidence and
decides the stable-tag and Trusted Publishing requirements for main PyPI
without publishing. Stage 5W.0 recorded the exact stable `v0.1.0` tag target
and commands without creating or pushing the tag. Stage 5W.0.1 created and
pushed that exact annotated stable tag. Stage 5W.0.2 verified isolated package
artifacts built from exact `v0.1.0`. Stage 5W.0.3 verified isolated
installation plus help-only CLI smoke from exact `v0.1.0`. Stage 5W.1
prepared main PyPI Trusted Publishing without publishing. Stage 5W.2 recorded
the user-attested exact publisher tuple and verified the local trust controls
without publishing. Stage 5W.3 published exact stable tag `v0.1.0` once through
Trusted Publishing and publicly verified main PyPI version `0.1.0`. Stage
5W.4 verified fresh main PyPI installation, installed metadata, and help-only
CLI entrypoints. Stage 5X recommends a separate GitHub Release creation stage
for `v0.1.0`; no GitHub Release was created during the decision. Stage 5X.1
created and verified the GitHub Release for existing stable tag `v0.1.0` and
closed release-chain `0.1.0`. Stage 5Y.0 added mirrored Russian and English
installation and first-run documentation for PyPI, repository, developer, and
upgrade paths. Stage 5Z.0 published and verified patch release `0.1.1`, created
its GitHub Release, and closed release-chain `0.1.1`.

Stage 5S release candidate tag plan is recorded as passed in [`reports/STAGE_5S_RELEASE_CANDIDATE_TAG_PLAN_REPORT.md`](reports/STAGE_5S_RELEASE_CANDIDATE_TAG_PLAN_REPORT.md); tag execution remains a separate explicitly authorized stage.
Stage 5T stable release decision keeps the project at release-candidate status because RC tag execution and post-RC smoke evidence are absent; see [`reports/STAGE_5T_STABLE_RELEASE_DECISION_REPORT.md`](reports/STAGE_5T_STABLE_RELEASE_DECISION_REPORT.md).
Stage 5U created and pushed annotated RC tag `v0.1.0-rc1`; post-RC smoke remains a separate stage; see [`reports/STAGE_5U_CREATE_RELEASE_CANDIDATE_TAG_REPORT.md`](reports/STAGE_5U_CREATE_RELEASE_CANDIDATE_TAG_REPORT.md).

## Stage lifecycle

Stage files move through this lifecycle:

```text
active task -> implementation -> tests/checks -> report -> lifecycle cleanup -> completed task history
```

Active files define executable work. Completed files preserve historical instructions. Reports record what actually happened.

Stage lifecycle cleanup is mandatory after a stage is fully complete and its final report exists:

- Move completed stage task files from [`active/`](active/) to [`completed/`](completed/).
- Move general launch prompts to [`../archive/old_prompts/`](../archive/old_prompts/).
- Update this index.
- Ensure [`active/`](active/) contains only unfinished or next active work.

General prompts and prompt packs usually belong under [`../archive/old_prompts/`](../archive/old_prompts/), not under `active/` or `completed/`.

Do not perform completion cleanup before the final stage report exists.

Before marking a stage complete, confirm the required work is done, required verification is recorded, the stage report exists, relevant docs are current, completed task files have moved to [`completed/`](completed/), launch prompts have moved to [`../archive/old_prompts/`](../archive/old_prompts/), and this index reflects the final stage state.

## Rules for agents

- Read `AGENTS.md` first.
- Execute only the active task requested by the user.
- Do not use completed task files as current instructions.
- Do not treat reports as feature requests.
- Do not use archived prompts or prompt packs as current guidance unless explicitly asked.
- Do not start future roadmap work without an active task.
- Keep docs and reports aligned with the behavior being changed.
